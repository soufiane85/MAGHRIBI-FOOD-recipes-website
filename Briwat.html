        <h1>Briwat</h1>
        <img src="Kip-briwat-Kookmutsjes-1024x754-1.jpg.webp" alt="Briwat">

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>2 cups raw almonds</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temp</li>
<li>1 cup white granulated sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
<li>2 tablespoons orange blossom water</li>
<li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons water</li>
<li>1 1/2 cup honey</li>
<li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
<li>Sesame seeds (optional garnish)</li>

     </ol>

     <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Blanch the almonds. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the raw almonds and boil JUST for 1 minute. Immediately after 1 minute, drain the water and run cold water over them to cool them down. Slide the almond between two fingers and the skin should pop up easily. Do this with the rest of the almonds.</li>

<li>Toss the almonds in olive oil. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20 minutes or just until golden. Allow the almonds to cool down. To a food processor, add the almonds, butter, sugar, cinnamon, and orange blossom water. Grind until you have a smooth thick paste. It should not be crumbly or grainy. Portion out 1 to 2 teaspoon of the dough onto a tray or parchment paper.</li>

<li>Prepare your flour mixture for sealing the briwat. Just combine flour and water in a small bowl and mix that together. For the egg roll papers, slice into long strips with a 2 inch width. Keep them sandwiched in between dampened napkins to prevent them from drying out. Place a ball of the almond paste at one edge of an egg roll paper strip. Fold small triangles tightly and once you're at the last fold, add the flour mixture to glue it shut. Repeat with the rest.</li>

<li>Preheat oil for frying in a large shallow pan. You only need to add enough oil to cover half of the briwat. While the oil is heating, add honey to a pot over low heat/simmer. The heat will thin out the honey so it is not thick to coat the briwat. Once the oil is hot enough, add the briwat. Allow to get golden brown on one side before flipping over, this process happens very fast so keep an eye out. Once the other side is golden brown as well, use a slotted spoon so any excess oil drains out and transfer to the honey. Allow it to sit in the honey for 3 minutes and push them down to ensure the whole thing is coated. Then take them out of the honey and place on a plate or in a container. You can choose to sprinkle them with sesame seeds now. While the briwat are soaking in the honey, you can also start frying the next batch. Doing these two processes at the same time is very efficient.</li>

<li>Store at room temperature in an air tight container or pop in the fridge and freezer to store for an extended time.</li>
