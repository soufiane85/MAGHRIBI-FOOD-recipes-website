        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>3 3/4 Cups Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Semolina</li>
            <li>2 Cups Water, lukewarm</li>
            <li>1 Packet rapid rise yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bloom your yeast: This basically just mean dissolving your yeast in warm water and waiting for it to bubble. 
                Once it starts bubbling, you know that your yeast is alive and kicking.</li>

            <li>Mix all your dry ingredients (flour, salt & semolina) in a large bowl.
                 Next add your water and yeast mixture. Mix your dough either using your hands or a sturdy big spoon.
                  The dough will be roughly put together. Don’t worry about shaping it for now. Just cover it and let it rest for 15 minutes. 
                This will allow your dough to hydrate and for it to relax.</li>

            <li>After 15 minutes, take your dough out of the bowl and shape it into a ball.
                 Place it back in the bowl and let it rest again for 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Divide your dough into 2. Drizzle some semolina on a work surface and flatten your dough.
                 Shape it into a circle that is about 1″ thick. 
                 Drizzle a parchment paper lined baking sheet with semolina and place your dough on it.
                  Cover your dough with a clean kitchen towel. 
                Let it rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour max.</li>
        
            <li>Preheat your oven at 450F.</li>
            <li>Uncover your baking sheet and bake your bread at 450F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. 
                Allow to cool down for 5-10 minutes before serving. Enjoy <3</li>
