            <h3>Bread Ingredients:</h3>
            <li>3½ cups flour (340 g)</li>
            <li>½ cup fine semolina (90 g)</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon yeast</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1½ cups warm water (approx. ⅓ liter)</li>

        <h3>Ingredients for Folding Bread:</h3>
        <li>1½ cups vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ cup fine semolina</li>
        <li>¼ cup very soft unsalted butter</li>
     </ol>

     <h2>Instructions:</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Mix all the dry ingredients in a large bowl.</li>

        <li>Add 1½ cups of warm water, and mix to form a dough. 
            Add more water if necessary to make a dough that is soft and easy to knead, 
            but not sticky.</li>

        <li>If the dough is too sticky to handle, add a little flour one tablespoon at a time. </li>

        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for 10 minutes, 
            (or knead the dough in a stand mixer with dough hook for 5 minutes), 
            until the dough is very smooth and elastic.</li>

        <li>Set a bowl of the melted/soft butter and some oil aside. Cover your hands with oil. 
            Begin by dividing the dough into golf ball size balls.</li>
        
        <li>Continue until all the dough is divided. </li>

        <li>Starting with the first ball you made,
             add more of the butter mixture to your hands and work surface. 
            Flatten the ball to a very, very thin layer.</li>

        <li>Rub some oil on top, and fold into thirds.</li>

        <li>Add some more oil and sprinkle some semolina on the strip and fold again into thirds.</li>

        <li>You should now have a small square of dough. Continue through the remaining balls.</li>
        <li>Heat up a skillet and add a small amount of oil to the pan. Keep it on a medium heat. 
            Starting with the first “package” that you assembled, oil your hands and begin flattening the dough. 
            It should be thin and remain in a square shape. Do not overwork or the layers meld together.</li>

        <li>Place into the warm skillet and cook until golden brown and slightly crunchy on he outside. 
            If it does not turn to a golden color, you are not using enough oil.</li>
